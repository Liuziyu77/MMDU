### Judgement and Statistic
This fold contains two files: `prompt.py` and `statistic.py`.

`prompt.py` is used to judge the output of LVLMs, and save the scores.

`statistic.py` is used to statistic the results and show the final results.

### Alternative solution
If you find the above method cumbersome, you can use [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit)   to test the results of LVLM on MMDU.
